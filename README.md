This is a project which is part of the module Data Management and Processing at Edinburgh Napier University.

It will create an application for loading a textfile, read the data line by line and store it in a JSON format. Further
it will then process and clean dirty data that the user can work with it properly afterwards. 
Finally, English stop words are removed, lemmatisation runs fully in parallel and topic modelling with MALLET is 
processed, putting out a CSV file with the top ten topics and the top ten words for each topic.
